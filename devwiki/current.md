# Current work

This is the active working queue for Worldloom.

Unlike the long-term roadmap, this document records work that has been consciously selected for near-term implementation or design. Completed work should be removed from this file; the Git history is the record of what was done.

## Now

1. **Non-grid spatial experiment on a real FMG slice.** Exercise a real committed FMG slice with explicit import/export coordinate-transform objects, keeping the spatial representation experimental rather than settling the canonical coordinate space.

2. **Minimal world save/load.** Define and test a minimal save/load representation, including an explicit encoding for tuple keys and sets. Keep this deliberately minimal rather than designing the eventual complete world-file format.

3. **FMG importer.** With the scope in [[devwiki/questions/fmg-import-scope]] resolved as the current MVP boundary, plan and implement the first snapshot importer after the preceding spatial and save/load work is complete.

## Later

- **Deferred: exclusive-producer validation.** The narrow validation step was deliberately skipped in favour of the spatial experiment; revisit it after the MVP path is further established. Do not add runtime guards, REFINES, or overlay-store semantics without separate authorisation.

- Inspect the generated GeoTIFF in an external GIS application and use the result to inform the next interface/internal-model experiment.
- Use the raster and spatial-field experiments to inform the eventual spatial-data contract without prematurely fixing it.
- Prefer an adapter and standard data exchange over implementing equivalent specialist functionality inside Worldloom.
- Expand event semantics and event consequences.
- Expand provenance and dependency history.
- Add versioned snapshots/checkpoints.
- Add event-triggered scheduling after the fixed-interval scheduler has been exercised.
- Test composition with increasingly realistic specialist systems.
- Add architectural, integration, reproducibility, performance, and domain-model validation as appropriate.
